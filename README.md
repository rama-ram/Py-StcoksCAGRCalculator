# Py-StcoksCAGRCalculator
To Calculate CAGR when a csv file from IIFL portfolio is uploaded

Download the project and place the csv of portfolio report from IIFL (for now tested for that) and run the main.py, New file with calculated CAGR will be generated in the same directory

P.S: 
1. from IIFL report, initial 4 rows should be removed which is the IIFL image
2. While extracting the report from IIFL, expand all the rows so that induvidual scrip purchases can be captured

Make informed decision on whether to continue holding the stock or not based on the CAGRs. Thumbrule should be > 12%
